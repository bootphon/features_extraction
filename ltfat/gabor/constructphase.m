function c=constructphase(s,g,a)
%CONSTRUCTPHASE  Construct the phase of a DGT
%   Usage:  c=constructphase(s,g,a);
%           c=constructphase(s,g,a,tol);
%
%   CONSTRUCTPHASE(s,g,a) will construct a suitable phase for the postive
%   valued coefficients s. 
%  
%   If s is the absolute values of the Gabor coefficients of a signal
%   obtained using the window g and time-shift a, i.e.:
%
%     c=dgt(f,g,a,M);
%     s=abs(c);
%
%   then constuctphase(s,g,a) will attempt to reconstruct c.
%
%   The window g must be Gaussian, i.e. g must have the value 'gauss'
%   or be a cell array {'gauss',tfr}.
%
%   CONSTRUCTPHASE(s,g,a,tol) does as above, but sets the phase of
%   coefficients less than tol to zero phase. This speeds up the
%   computation. By default, tol has the value 1e-10.
%
%   This function requires a computational subroutine that is only
%   available in C. Use LTFATMEX to compile it.
