function f=dft(f,N,dim);
%DFT   Normalized Discrete Fourier Transform
%   Usage: f=dft(f);
%          f=dft(f,N,dim);
%
%   DFT computes a normalized discrete Fourier transform. This is nothing
%   but a scaled version of the output from fft. The function takes exactly
%   the same arguments as fft. See the help on fft for a thorough
%   description.
