%GFB_ANALYZER_NEW  Construct new analyzer object
%   Usage:  analyzer = gfb_analyzer_new(fs,flow, basef, fhigh,filters_per_ERBaud,gamma_order,bandwidth_factor)
%   Input parameters:
%      fs                 : The sampling frequency of the signals on which
%                           the analyzer will operate
%      flow               : The lowest possible center frequency of a
%                           contained gammatone filter
%      basef              : "base frequency". One of the gammatone filters of the analyzer
%                           will have this center frequency.  Must be >= flow
%      fhigh              : The highest possible center frequency of a
%                           contained gammatone filter.  Must be >=  basef
%      filters_per_ERBaud : The density of gammatone filters on the ERB
%                           scale.
%      gamma_order        : The order of the gammatone filters in this
%                           filterbank. If unspecified, the default value from
%                           gfb_set_constants.m is used.
%      bandwidth_factor   : The bandwidth parameter of the individual filters
%                           is calculated from the Equivalent Rectangular
%                           Bandwidth (ERB) according to equation 14 in
%                           Hohmann (2002). ERB is taken from the Glasberg &
%                           Moore formula for a specific center frequency
%                           (equation 13 in Hohmann (2002)).
%                           Using this parameter, it is possible to widen or
%                           narrow all filters of the filterbank with a
%                           constant bandwidth factor.
%                           Default value is 1.0
%
%   Output parameters:
%      analyzer           : The constructed gfb_analyzer object.
%    
%   GFB_ANALYZER_NEW constructs a new `gfb_analyzer` object.  The analyzer
%   implements the analysis part of a gammatone filterbank as described
%   in Hohmann (2002).
%
%   It consists of several all-pole gammatone filters; each
%   one with a bandwidth of 1 ERBaud (times bandwidth_factor),
%   and an order of gamma_order.
%
%   The center frequencies of the individual filters are computed as
%   described in section 3 of Hohmann (2002).
