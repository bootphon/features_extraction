function mixer = gfb_mixer_new(analyzer, delay, iterations)
%GFB_MIXER_NEW  Create new mixer
%   Usage: mixer = gfb_mixer_new(analyzer, delay, iterations)
%
%   Input parameters:
%     analyzer : A gfb_analyzer structure as created by gfb_analyzer_new. The
%                mixer created by this function can act as part of a synthesizer
%                that resynthesizes the output of this analyzer
%     delay    : A gfb_Delay structure as created by gfb_delay_new, Together with
%                the mixer created by this function, this delay can form a
%                synthesizer that resynthesizes the output of the analyzer
%     iterations : The gain factors are approximated numerically in iterations.
%                If this parameter is omitted, then the number of iterations will
%                be  GFB_GAINCALC_ITERATIONS (see gfb_set_constants.m, usually
%                =100)
%
%   GFB_MIXER_NEW creates a `gfb_mixer` object with gain factors suitable
%   to calculate a weighted sum of the bands present in the output of the
%   given delay.  The gain factors are computed using a numerical optimization
%   method described in [Herzke & Hohmann 2007].
