function zresponse = gfb_analyzer_zresponse(analyzer, z)
%GFB_ANALYZER_ZRESPONSE  Frequency response
%   USAGE: zresponse = gfb_analyzer_zresponse(analyzer, z)
%
%   Input parameters:
%     analyzer : A gfb_analyzer struct as created by gfb_analyzer_new.
%     z        : A vector of z-plane frequencies where the frequency response
%                should be computed. z = exp(2i*pi*f/fs)
%
%   Output parameters:
%     zresponse : The complex frequency response of the filter
%
%   GFB_ANALYZER_ZRESPONSE(analyzer,z) computes the frequency response of
%   the gammatone filters in the filterbank at the frequencies z.
%   The frequency responses of the filters in the filterbank are stored
%   as columns in the output.
